Rules
=====

General
-------
- Semantic versioning must always be followed:
--- Versions use the format vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., v1.2.0).
--- Pre-release and build metadata should follow semantic versioning guidelines (e.g., v1.2.0-alpha.1, v2.0.0-beta, v1.0.0-rc.3).
--- Additional build identifiers may be appended for specific use cases:
------ dev = Development builds
------ snapshot = Snapshot builds for testing
------ beta = Public/closed beta testing builds
------ rc = Release candidates prior to stable
------ No suffix = Stable release

- Sample application binaries must follow the naming convention:[project name]_sample-[version].[extension]


Android
-------
- If a sample implementation exists, then it must be placed in the optional `sample` package, even if it resides in a separate module.

- The main API/library code must always reside in a module named after the project in lowercase (preferred), or in a generalized module named `core` or `library`.

- The sample implementation of a `library`/`core` module must be placed in a module named `sample` (never app).



Crossplatform
-------------
- Projects must follow the IODevBlue Naming Convention: [root].[domain].[target].[project_name].(optional)[subdomain]


- `universal` must be used as the target when the codebase is platform-agnostic or shared across multiple targets.

- Each project has a single root package and additional aspects (AI, docs, sandbox, service, etc.) must be expressed as subdomains of that project.

- Avoid mixing multiple domains at the top level. Instead, attach them as subdomains within the project scope.
Example:
io.github.iodevblue.game.universal.yellowbeams.ai
io.github.iodevblue.game.universal.yellowbeams.docs
io.github.iodevblue.game.universal.yellowbeams.service


- Subdomains should only be introduced when the project logically requires separate concerns (e.g., ai, docs, service, iot).

- Keep domain and target classification consistent with the convention definitions.
